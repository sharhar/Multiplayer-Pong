# Multiplayer Pong
This repository contains a pong game made in sfml that uses tcp sockets for multiplayer game-play. 

### How to run
To run the binaries go to the bin folder and then go to the folder with your os name.

### How to use
Before opening any clients open the server and type in the port that the server will use. Then open the clients and type in the server information (first the ip address and then the port). When the second client connects the score counter will count down from 3 to 0. At 0 the game will start.
